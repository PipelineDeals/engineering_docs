# OKRs

The Engineering team at PipelineDeals uses OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) for its goal setting process.

## Objectives

These tell you where we want to go.  Below are a few examples of objectives:

* Improve the technical brand of PipelineDeals
* Grow the company revenue to 5MM yearly.
* Ship our Saturn project.

## Key results

For any objective there will be at most 4-5 key results.  Key results are quantifiable, e.g. they should have a measurable number associated with them.

__Objective: Improve the technical brand of PipelineDeals__

Example key results:
* At least one blog post to the first page on Hacker News this quarter
* Start a twitter account gain 200 twitter followers this quarter
* Speak at 2 conferences this quarter

## OKRs are hierarchial

OKRs are [hierarchical](http://www.slideshare.net/jaymeh13/object-25288039?related=4).  The company sets their quarterly objectives and from that, they flow down to the teams, and then to the individual members.

The above objective would be an objective for the engineering team as a whole.  For an individual, they might look something like this:

__Objective: Improve the technical brand of PipelineDeals__

Example key results:
* Write 2 well thought-out blog posts this quarter
* Speak at 2 conferences this quarter

This goal setting will happen quarterly and there are different types of objectives that key results for an individual can appear for:

* Job requirements objectives
* Company objectives
* Project objectives
* Personal objectives
