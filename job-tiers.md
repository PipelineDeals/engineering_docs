# Engineering Job tiers at PipelineDeals

PipelineDeals does not have formal titles for engineers.  While we tend to hire "Senior" engineers over juniors, there is not a ladder to climb after Senior engineer, unless someone opts to be a Team Lead.  This follows closely with the [Netflix approach](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-levels-titles-at-Netflix-in-the-engineering-ladder-and-in-the-management-ladder-and-how-do-they-compare-to-big-high-tech-companies-like-Google).  This does not mean there are not promotions, however.  Salaries are reviewed annually and compensation is determined by how much impact and responsibility each engineer demonstrates.
