# Manager stuff for managers

Hello!  If you're reading this, that means you're probably managing engineers at PipelineDeals.  Well, great.  Knock em' dead!  You have nothing but potential.

Managing effectively is a big subject, but in this document I hope to bring the basics, the essentials into it to help you and your directs stay happy and effective.

There are 3 main components to managing effectively at PipelineDeals:

1.  The quarterly Review
2.  One on Ones
3.  The performance apprasial

Each of the 3 above tie into each other.

## The quarterly review

Each quarter, you'll give a review to your directs.  This review encompasses discussing how each direct did with the goals you laid out for them for the quarter.

During this meeting, you'll work with your direct to come up with new goals for the next quarter.

Some examples of goals are the following:

* Deliver and own the performance and reliability of hound.
* Push the team to deliver on the blog post goal.
* Help the team push forward on the performance + metrics goals for the app and queues.
* Deliver frank's performance review on 2/23, utilizing the performance appraisal framework.
* Own + deploy the faster deployment solution.

Take notes about how your direct did for each of their previous goals.


# One on Ones

In general, we follow the format outlined by manager-tools.com for one-on-ones.

The document that describes how one-on-ones work is here: https://drive.google.com/a/pipelinedealsco.com/file/d/0B4NtZYgeIrfqWThJem4zNlNmXzA/view?usp=sharing

Each time you meet with your direct, take notes.  The meeting should generally follow the format:

* 10 minutes for direct
* 10 minutes for you
* Talk about future and nudging towards meeting quarterly goals

There is also a document that shows how to take notes during the one on one session:

# Performance appraisal

The one on ones and quarterly reviews will all feed into the performance appraisal.

* Self-assessment questionnaire (due 2 weeks before review is delivered).  Self-asssessment will be incorporated into annual review.
* Review from peers
* Review up (how is your manager doing)
*
