# Performance review process

## Collect the data.

The 5 places to collect data:

1. **The job description itself.**

Is the job description accurate?  Complete?

Ask yourself these questions:

* The reason the company created the job is: <blank>
* The most important ways a person doing this job should spend their time are <blank>
* The 2-3 most important duties of this job are <blank>
* What this job takes to be successful is <blank>
* This simples, easiest way to see if this job is being done well is <blank>

All of above is about the *job*, not the *candidate*.

2. **The job holder.**

* Objective data.  # of calls, average quality score, # of errors, etc.
* Critical incidents.  Good, bad, big or small.  Anything that provides insight
* Behavioral observations

3.  **Individual data**

* Gather previous performance reviews, their resume.

4. **Self apprasial**

5.  **Organizational input**

* This is review from peers.

## Evaluate data.

**Begin with the end in mind**

* What is my core message to this person?
* What is the *one thing* I want her to learn from this?

**Watch for common evaluation errors**

* Halo/horns effect -- you like or dislike the person and so generalize to every part of their performance baswed upon that one perception.
* Similar to me effect -- Person does better than they should because they resemble you.  Either in appearance or personality traits -- drive/ambition, career path / background, etc.

**Distribution analysis**

* based upon what you know now of all employees, see how they all lay out on a bell curve

## Write review.

* Make your case for your core message using a combination of behaviors and results / performance.
* Does the preponderance of the information support your core message?

**Use SEER technique**

Summarize, elaborate, example, restate

"Bob is my best customer service rep. He consistently exceeds every standard. He recently saved a difficult call after three other reps had failed. He's an example we ought to put on training videos."

**Sum-Ex method**

Summarize behavior or performance, then give an example.  Two sentences, no more.

"Bob is my best customer service rep.  Recently he saved a difficult call despite 3 other reps not being able to."

In both techniques, avoid commas.  Short is better.
